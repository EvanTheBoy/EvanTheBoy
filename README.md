### Hi, it's so nice to meet you here! ðŸ‘‹
I am an undergraduate majoring in Computer Science and Technology, and I am interested in many fields related to computer science.

I have a few simple projects on back-end written in java and python, along with a research project on NLP, from which you can see that there could be just a lot more improvements and progress.

We are all on our way to becoming stronger, and that will never stop. If you have a favorable impression of me, please do not hesitate to contact me by my email and I believe we can have a great conversation!
