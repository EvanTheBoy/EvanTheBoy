### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am currently an undergraduate majoring in Computer Science and Technology, and I am interested in many fields related to computers.

I have a few simple projects on back-end written in java and python, along with one research project on NLP, from which you can see that there could be just a lot more improvements and progress.

We are all on our way to becoming stronger, and that is never going to stop. If you like me, welcome to contact me at my email and we can have a great conversation!
