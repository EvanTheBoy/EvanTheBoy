### Hi, it's so nice to meet you here! ðŸ‘‹
I am an undergraduate majoring in Computer Science and Technology, and I am interested in many fields related to computer science.

I have completed a few projects written in Java, Python, and Golang, along with a research project on NLP. I am also learning new technologies and continuously improving myself.

We are all on our journey to becoming stronger, and that journey will never end. If you have a favorable impression of me, please feel free to contact me via email. I believe we can have a great conversation!
